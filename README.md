# Langchain ChatBot Project using Flask-ChromaDB-Langchain-OpenAI-React.JS

Welcome to the Awesome ChatBot project! This repository houses the code for a powerful chatbot with an interactive user interface. By following the steps below, you'll have the backend and frontend components up and running in no time.

## Getting Started

### Backend Setup

1. **Python Installation:** Ensure you have Python 3.10 or higher installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Virtual Environment Setup:** It's recommended to use a virtual environment for this project. If you're using Anaconda, follow these steps:
   a. Open the Anaconda prompt in the repository's location.
   b. Run: `conda create -p venv python=3.10 -y` (replace `venv` with your desired environment name).
   c. Activate the virtual environment: `conda activate venv`

3. **Dependency Installation:** Install project dependencies using the activated Conda terminal:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Note: You'll need the Visual Studio C++ Build Tool to install ChromaDB. If not already installed, you can get it from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools). Choose the "Setup Development for C++" package.
    Note: You'll need the RUST Compiler to install SentenceTransformers. If not already installed, you can get it from [Visual Studio Downloads](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/?q=build+tools](https://rustup.rs/)). 

5. **Run the Backend:** Once dependencies are installed, run the backend server:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

### Frontend Setup

1. **Node.js Installation:** Ensure you have Node.js installed. If not, you can download it from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download).

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies:** Follow these steps to set up the frontend:
   a. Navigate to the "frontend" folder in the root directory.
   b. Open a command prompt in this folder.
   c. Run: `npm install`

3. **Start the Frontend:** After installing dependencies, start the frontend app:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Notes

- **Running Both Apps:** Make sure to have both the frontend and backend applications running concurrently to experience the seamless functionality of the chatbot.
